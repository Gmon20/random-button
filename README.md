# random-button
Program with a single button that does one (1) random thing each time you click it

I just made this in my free time to 1. re-familiarize myself with Java swing/awk stuff and 2. kill some time. It's super simple and doesn't do a whole lot (as you're about to see), but I had fun making it and realzing that I do in fact still know how to code lol.

Clicking the button will do one of following 5 things:
1. Nothing
2. Force close the app
3. Add a bevel border to the button
4. Change the icon of the window
5. Make the button blue
Like I said, this project was just a small thing I made to start getting into Java swing stuff again. I tried to pick a few things you can do with swing and programmed the button to do as many of them as I could without making it unrunnable. In the future, I might add more things to what the button can do. Also optimizing the code would be helpful as it is being held together by a ton of if/else statements and a lot of duct tape lol

I wrapped the code into an .exe file, but I will also include the source code in case you want to take a look (again, sorry in advance for the messy code lol). Hope you enjoy!
